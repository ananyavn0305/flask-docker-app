## What I’ve Done In This Project

### 1. Built a small web app using Flask
→ It’s a lightweight Python framework that can serve web pages or APIs.\
→ My app shows a simple message: ‘Hello from Flask inside Docker!’

### 2. Wrote a requirements.txt file
→ This lists all the dependencies (like Flask) that the app needs.

### 3. Created a Dockerfile
→ This is like a recipe that tells Docker how to build & run the app.

### 4. Built a Docker Image
→ Using docker build, I created a portable image of the app.

### 5. Ran the App inside a Docker Container
→ I launched it with docker run & the app ran perfectly on port 5000.\
→ I could open the app in the browser using http://localhost:5000.

### 6. Verified portability
→ The same image can run on any machine with Docker — no setup needed!
